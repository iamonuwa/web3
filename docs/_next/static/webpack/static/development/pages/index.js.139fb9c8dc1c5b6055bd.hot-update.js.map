This talk explores strategies that could help create a new option for startups: Exit to community. In E2C, the company would transition from investor ownership to ownership by the people who rely on it most---in the case of an online platform, its users. The mechanism for co-ownership might be a cooperative, a trust, or even crypto-tokens. The community might own the whole company when the process is over, or just a substantial-enough part of it to make a difference. These kinds of options could help prevent the massive accountability crises that now beset today’s most successful venture-backed startups.'\n    />\n\n    <Row\n      name='\"Traveler`s Tales: The 1st 20 Years Of Open Source\"'\n      author='Jim Jagielski'\n      description='A look back at the history of the 1st 20 years of open source, and a peek at the next 20 by one of the leaders of the open source movement'\n    />\n\n  </div>\n)\n\nexport default Table\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAHA;AACA;AAMA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAHA;AACA;AAKA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AAHA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AACA;AACA;AAHA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AACA;AACA;AAHA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAdA;AACA;AAsBA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
